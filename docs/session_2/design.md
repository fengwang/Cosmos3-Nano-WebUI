# GPU-S2 Design — HF Checkpoint Index/LFS Fix and Re-Pin Sweep

Date: 2026-07-09
Input: `docs/session_2/proposal.md`

## Context

Both `wfen/Cosmos3-Nano-{FP8,NVFP4}-Blockwise` repos ship a top-level
`model.safetensors.index.json` that references seven non-existent shards
(the real transformer weight is one consolidated file), and both
`.gitattributes` force every `.json`/`.py`/`.txt`/`.jinja` file into LFS via
blanket extension patterns regardless of size. A plain `git clone` therefore
leaves small config/tokenizer files as unresolved LFS pointers and a loader
looking for shards that don't exist. This has been proven, twice, as a real,
GPU-verified bug (the post-GO gate and `GPU-S1`'s own smoke test) — both
times worked around locally and undocumented. This session makes that fix
real, public, and at the source.

Constraint: `session_2_contract.yaml`'s `blast_radius` — external
`wfen/Cosmos3-Nano-{FP8,NVFP4}-Blockwise` repos, plus `docs/session_2/**`,
`docs/model_setup.md`, `docs/evidence_map.md`, `docs/risk_register.md`,
`docs/release_checklist.md`, `docs/eval_seed_cases.md`, `docs/handoff.md` in
this repo; `api/**`, `webui/**`, `deploy/**`, `schemas/**`, `.github/**`, and
any weight/media file are forbidden. `project_contract.md` Hard Commitments
2/3/5 (fresh-verification discipline, atomic re-pin, outward-action gate)
and invariants INV-4/5/7 apply without exception. Unlike `GPU-S1`, this
session's primary work happens **outside** this git repository, in two
external, already-public Hugging Face repos — an irreversible-ish,
outward-visible action class this project hasn't executed yet.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Both `wfen/*` repos: top-level stale index removed; LFS tracking
  corrected by the owner's size/type rule; large weight files never
  de-LFS'd.
- A fresh `git clone` and a fresh `hf download`, from a client that hasn't
  touched these repos before, resolve every small file as real content (not
  an LFS/Xet pointer) and find no stale index.
- Every in-repo pinned reference moves to the new revisions in this session;
  a whole-repository sweep finds zero stale survivors outside the one
  documented historical exception in `docs/eval_seed_cases.md`.
- An owner go-ahead is recorded immediately before each of the two pushes.

**Non-Goals** (`docs/session_2.md` Out of Scope):
- Dev-scratch **content** cleanup (D3: `_s2_*.md`, `producer_provenance.json`,
  `load_quantized.py`, `assets/FP8-Examples/**`, benchmark PNGs) — only their
  LFS storage mechanism is touched as a side effect of the repo-wide rule
  fix; their existence, content, and location do not change.
- Rewriting large weight files out of LFS.
- Dockerfile changes (`GPU-S1`, already closed).
- Upstream PR work (`GPU-S4`/`GPU-S5`).
- Full GPU load+generate proof — that's `GPU-S3`'s job. This session proves
  packaging/structural correctness (no stale index, no unresolved pointer),
  not runtime generation.

## Decisions

1. **Fresh-clone discipline, two independent clones per repo, both outside
   this git repository.** Clone (a): a working clone in the scratchpad used
   to make and push the fix. Clone (b): a separate, independent post-push
   clone/`hf download` used only to verify. Neither ever reuses the
   pre-existing `/data/models/Cosmos3-Nano-{FP8,NVFP4}-Blockwise*`
   directories — those are already-modified, uncommitted local checkouts,
   exactly the "already-patched checkout" the contract says not to rely on.
2. **LFS technique: trim `.gitattributes` + `git add --renormalize .`**
   (Approach A from brainstorming). Remove the blanket `*.json`, `*.py`,
   `*.txt`, `*.jinja` LFS lines; keep the genuine binary patterns
   (`*.safetensors`, `*.pt`, `*.pth`, `*.ckpt`, `*.mp4`, `*.png`, `*.jpg`,
   etc.) and the size-justified `text_tokenizer/tokenizer.json` override
   untouched. No `git lfs migrate export`, no history rewrite, no
   force-push.
3. **Two separate commits per repo, not one.** Commit 1: `git rm
   model.safetensors.index.json` alone. Commit 2: the `.gitattributes` edit
   plus `git add --renormalize .`. Isolating the renormalize into its own
   commit makes the "did any large file's LFS OID change" check (directly
   guarding R-04) a trivial single-commit `git lfs ls-files` diff, and keeps
   each commit independently revertable.
4. **Verification runs the real client tools, scoped to avoid tensor
   bytes.** `GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone` and `hf download --exclude
   "*.safetensors" --exclude "*.pt"` (or equivalent) are still real
   invocations of the two named tools — they just don't pull the ~24–27 GB
   of weight bytes per repo, which this session's checks don't need
   (`GPU-S3` owns the functional GPU load). The probe inspects the resulting
   local directory directly (no top-level index; small files are real text,
   not `version https://git-lfs...` pointer stubs) and cross-checks against
   `HfApi.get_paths_info` manifest metadata (does a path report an `.lfs`
   attribute or not) as an independent second signal — reusing the
   functional-core/imperative-shell shape of
   `docs/archive/phase-1/session_4/probes/verify_hf_checkpoints.py` without
   needing its `parse_header` tensor-header reader (this session doesn't
   need precision/header inspection, only manifest-level packaging checks).
5. **Verification cache isolation.** This sandbox has already touched both
   repos (the pre-existing `/data/models/...` clones), so the default HF
   cache could mask a genuinely-fresh client's view behind the contract's
   own named Xet-caching failure mode. The verification pass points
   `HF_HOME`/`GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE` at a clean scratch directory that has
   never cached these two repos, and records that isolation as part of the
   evidence, rather than asserting freshness without demonstrating it.
6. **Order: FP8 fully first, end to end,** then replay the identical,
   by-then-validated recipe for NVFP4. Reduces the chance of hitting (and
   misdiagnosing) the same failure twice across both repos.
7. **Push gate is a hard stop, not a note.** The literal `git push` for FP8
   is never issued in the same step as anything else — it is preceded by an
   explicit, separate "push now?" confirmation. The same applies
   independently for NVFP4 after FP8's full cycle (including its own
   independent post-push verification) is done.
8. **R-02 mitigation lands as a repo-side note, not an HF-side edit.**
   Record the revision change directly in `docs/risk_register.md`'s R-02
   row; do not edit either HF repo's own README/model card (keeps the
   external blast radius to exactly index+LFS, per the "ignore
   `-dist`/don't fold in extra content" decision).

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **[Risk]** `git add --renormalize .` re-filters something unintended
  (pattern-removal mistake pulls a large file into the "now regular git"
  set) → **Mitigation:** Decision 3's commit split makes `git lfs ls-files`
  before/after that one commit a direct diff; assert the large-file OID set
  is unchanged before pushing (directly guards R-04, a named contract risk).
- **[Risk]** HF's Xet backend caches old pointer state in this
  already-touched sandbox, masking whether the fix works for a genuinely
  fresh client (contract's own named failure mode) → **Mitigation:**
  Decision 5 — isolated cache dir for the verification pass, recorded as
  evidence.
- **[Risk]** A push happens without a timely, explicit go-ahead (named
  adversarial case) → **Mitigation:** Decision 7 — the push command is
  never batched with other actions.
- **[Risk]** The re-pin sweep updates some but not all referencing files
  (named adversarial case) → **Mitigation:** run the sweep only after every
  planned doc edit is complete, and treat any match outside the one
  documented historical exception as a hard failure requiring another pass.
- **[Risk]** R-02 — an early adopter who already pulled the pre-fix revision
  breaks silently when the pin moves → **Mitigation:** explicitly accepted,
  one-time public-beta cost per the risk register's own mitigation;
  documented, not solved in code.
- **[Risk]** FP8 and NVFP4 diverge unexpectedly (e.g. NVFP4's `.gitattributes`
  already differs slightly from FP8's — confirmed during brainstorming) so
  the "identical recipe" assumption from Decision 6 doesn't transfer
  cleanly → **Mitigation:** re-derive NVFP4's exact diff from its own current
  `.gitattributes`/`lfs ls-files` state rather than blindly copying FP8's
  patch; both were already read in full during brainstorming, so the actual
  per-repo differences are already known, not a surprise to react to later.

## Migration Plan

No running production system in this repo depends on the old HF revision
directly — `GPU-S1`'s own T2I evidence used the local workaround, not the
raw pin. Rollout: fix and verify each HF repo locally first; push only after
an explicit go-ahead; re-pin this repo's docs in the same session (Hard
Commitment 3 — no session ends partially re-pinned). Rollback, if a pushed
HF commit proves wrong: push a further corrective commit to that HF repo
(a normal git remote, not registry-immutable) and re-run this repo's re-pin
sweep against whatever the corrected revision becomes; neither case involves
a force-push or history rewrite, since Decision 2 avoided that surface
entirely. Downstream: `GPU-S3` consumes the new revision hashes, the
LFS/`.gitattributes` recipe, and the fresh-clone verification evidence as
its explicit starting input (`session_2.md` Handoff section).

## Open Questions

- Exact size of each repo's `.gitattributes` diff — resolved empirically
  once the live file is edited; not a decision the design needs to
  pre-resolve.
- Whether Xet-backend caching in this sandbox would have actually masked
  anything in practice, or is a non-issue here — will be recorded as
  evidence either way (Decision 5), not assumed.

Both are implementation-time findings, not decisions the design needs to
pre-resolve.
