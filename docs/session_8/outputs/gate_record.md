# Gate Record - MIG-S1 .. MIG-S8

Date: 2026-07-07 · Branch: `session-8` (not pushed; `origin/main` = seed `c3983f7`)

## Migration gates

| Gate | Status | Public evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `GATE-MIG-S1-SCOPE` | **PASS** | `docs/session_1/{inventory,import_manifest,exclusion_manifest,scrub_checklist}.md`; baseline scans clean (`evidence_map.md`) |
| `GATE-MIG-S2-VLLM` | **PASS** | Fork branch/tag `cosmos3-nano-webui-mig-s2` = `697035018b70cef76b974a909d23371a9984c3f2` (public `git ls-remote`); S2 targeted tests 118 passed |
| `GATE-MIG-S3-IMPORT` | **PASS** | 296 files curated; `compileall api`=0, torch-free `import app.main`=0, `pytest -m "not gpu"` = 485 passed; private-ref/weight/legacy scans clean |
| `GATE-MIG-S4-HF` | **PASS** (metadata verified; drift documented) | Revisions FP8 `4e181f99…` / NVFP4 `b5c9332e…`; license `openmdw-1.0`; self-contained; local==public sha; drift D1/D2/D4 in `docs/session_4/drift_report.md` |
| `GATE-MIG-S5-CI` | **PASS** (config verified + locally green; hosted run at-publish) | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; `deterministic_checks.md` #2–#9 (ruff 0, pytest 485, vitest 209, build/lint/typecheck green); schema-sync gates proven to fail on drift |
| `GATE-MIG-S6-DOCKER` | **PASS** (render + lean builds; vllm-omni image = S8 gate) | `deterministic_checks.md` #10/#11 (compose fp8/nvfp4 exit 0, 0-byte stderr); api+webui `docker build` exit 0; external `:ro` mounts, loopback default |
| `GATE-MIG-S7-PUBLIC` | **PASS** | `README.md` (190 lines, evidence-qualified) + `LICENSE`/`SECURITY.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md`/`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` + templates + `release_checklist.md`; 10 README links resolve; X-1 fixed (`INV-9`) |
| `GATE-MIG-S8-BETA` | **RECOMMENDED: GO (public beta / research preview)** — advisory, **owner ratifies** | This session: `acceptance_matrix.md` (14 PASS / 2 BETA-LIMITED / 0 NO-GO), `deterministic_checks.md` (all green), `evidence_review.md`, reconciled risk register (no unowned blocker) |

## Manual GPU gate status (deferred — owner decision 1)

The entire GPU inference surface is **NOT-YET-RUN / beta-limited**. `INV-8` is satisfied
because every mode is marked GPU-unverified in the README. Any later run **must match** these
pins/revisions or the evidence is invalid:

- vLLM-Omni fork commit: `697035018b70cef76b974a909d23371a9984c3f2`
- FP8 checkpoint `wfen/Cosmos3-Nano-FP8-Blockwise` @ `4e181f996abf03f3425298ef692e6e5e56fd46a4`
- NVFP4 checkpoint `wfen/Cosmos3-Nano-NVFP4-Blockwise` @ `b5c9332efbaefa72c99890b1b1150da12ca9256c`
- BF16 base `nvidia/Cosmos3-Nano` (reasoning + action/forward_dynamics)

Cases deferred: `EV-MIG-GPU-FP8-T2V`, `-FP8-T2V-AUDIO`, `-FP8-I2V`, `-FP8-T2I`, `-FP8-FD`,
`-NVFP4-SURFACE`, `-REASONING`, `-JOBS-SSE`, `-ARTIFACTS` (see `eval_seed_cases.md`).
Required evidence fields per run: hardware, driver/CUDA, checkpoint repo+revision, vLLM-Omni
commit, request shape, artifact metadata, pass/fail (`NFR-6`).

**Drift D1** (open beta limitation, routed to the GPU session): the in-process
`diffusers_oracle` cannot load+verify either current public checkpoint as-is; the default
engine is the `vllm_omni` container path, whose real serve compatibility is unverified.

## Recommended verdict and rule

**Recommendation: GO for public beta / research preview — advisory; the owner records the
binding GO/NO-GO.**

GO rule (D-6) — all clauses hold, each backed by evidence:

| GO clause | Met? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Scrub clean | ✅ | `deterministic_checks.md` #12–#15 |
| CPU checks green | ✅ | `deterministic_checks.md` #2–#9 (pytest 485, vitest 209, ruff 0, build/lint/typecheck) |
| Compose fp8+nvfp4 render clean | ✅ | `deterministic_checks.md` #10/#11 |
| `LICENSE` + hygiene present & correct | ✅ | `GATE-MIG-S7-PUBLIC`; three-way license separation |
| Every runtime claim evidence-qualified | ✅ | `evidence_review.md`; README per-mode GPU-unverified (S7) |
| No unowned release-blocking risk | ✅ | reconciled `risk_register.md` (R-05/R-08/R-13/R-16 carry owner beta-limited dispositions) |
| GPU surface marked beta-limited | ✅ | this record + README + `acceptance_matrix.md` FR-9/NFR-6 |
| Every PRD MUST covered | ✅ | `acceptance_matrix.md` (16 MUSTs; 0 NO-GO) |

**GO is conditional on** (not blockers — post-publish / standing):
1. The standing **beta-limited GPU gate** — the full GPU surface is unverified; each mode is
   marked GPU-unverified. First post-publish task is the GPU session (run `EV-MIG-GPU-*`,
   build the pinned vLLM-Omni image, resolve drift D1).
2. **At-publish items** (`release_checklist.md` §9): enable GitHub Private vulnerability
   reporting; confirm the CI badge + `security/policy` + `discussions` links resolve once
   public; set repo About/topics; tag + release notes; **owner records GO/NO-GO**.
3. **At-publish CI confirmation** (§5): confirm `ci.yml` is green on the GitHub-hosted runner
   on the release commit (local equivalents already green).

If the owner requires GPU evidence **before** any public exposure, the verdict is **NO-GO
until the GPU session passes** — this is the single lever that flips the recommendation, and
it is the owner's call. No other release blocker is open.
